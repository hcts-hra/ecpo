# ECPO
This is the research data repository of the project [Early Chinese Periodicals Online (ECPO)](https://www.hcts.uni-heidelberg.de/en/research/heidelberg-research-architecture/early-chinese-periodicals-online), especially the  part dedicated to generating [ECPO full text](https://www.hcts.uni-heidelberg.de/en/research/heidelberg-research-architecture/ecpo-full-text). 

The repo contains the ground truth data we produced manually from Jing bao 晶報:
-   April 1939 (10 issues, each 4 folds)
-   April 1930 (10 issues, each 2 folds)
-   April 1920 (10 issues, each 2 folds)

The user frontend of the ECPO online database can be accessed at [https://uni-heidelberg.de/ecpo](https://uni-heidelberg.de/ecpo).
